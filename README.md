# docker-containers
This is a Mythtv .28 docker running in phusion base 0.9.19 (based on ubuntu 16.04).   

All of the scripts were originally written by SparklyBall's sparkly-mythtv
https://github.com/sparklyballs/docker-containers.

I am waiting for his permission or direction to determine where to proceed here.
I only modified a few lines of a couple of the files to point to the new locations in the newer phusion base.  
So 99.999 percent of this work is his and he should be the one taking the credit.  

I just needed a .28 mythtv docker container that would work for my unraid setup.   Since I 
have been using his for the last year or so,   I would like to try and contribute back.

If I am doing anything wrong by doing this,  please tell me and I will take it down.

Thank You,
