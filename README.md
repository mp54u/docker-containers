# mp54u/docker-containers

### myth28:
Purpose: This docker is used for running mythtv .28 on UNRAID 6.1+  It is built
100% based off of Sparklyballs's sparkly-mythtv docker found here https://github.com/sparklyballs/docker-containers.
-  Uses mythbuntu .28 ppa
-  based on phusion/baseimage 0.9.19 found at https://hub.docker.com/r/phusion/baseimage/
   This baseimage is based on Ubuntu 16.04.

I am waiting for permission from Sparklyballs to either have him add this to his repo or give me permission 
to publish in Community apps for unraid.  It is his work and I don't want to take credit.   I only changed 
a few paths in the dockerfile and run scripts to point to locations that changed due to phusion baseimage change.
Since I am new to all this,  I want to make sure I follow proper procedure for all things related to his work and 
others work that was involved.   

Thank You,
mp54u
