# MythTv
This docker is NOT ready for USE!!!!

This is my first real foray into trying to help and keep an updated mythtv docker container. 
This work is really all from Sparklyballs who created the original container that I have
been using for the last year or so.   I needed Mythtv .28 for some of the new api features
so I decided to give it a go to get mythtv .28 working.  Hopefully I can make this work.

ISSUE - Mythtv .28 requires QT5 libraries.   With QT5,  The mythtv-setup launches when in
RDP window,  but the keyboard does not work.   It is required for most of the setup so that 
is a big problem.   I am researching.    Hopefully once we get past this,   it works as 
expected.  Everything else seems to be working fine as far as I can tell.



NOTE:  This container is NOT working yet.   I am just learning how to get the build
stuff worked out so I can start troubleshooting.  If I can't get it working,  I will delete the repo
