# docker-containers
My first real foray into trying to help and keep an updated mythtv docker container. 
This work is really all from Sparklyballs who created the original container that I have
been using for the last year or so.   Unraid is a great way to keep my home video needs 
and storage covered.   So, if I can get good enough at this,  I can contribute back and maybe
figure out how to get my changes to Sparklyballs.

Heres to learning :-)
